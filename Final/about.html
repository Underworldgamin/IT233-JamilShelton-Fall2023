            <h3>Hi, I'm Jamil Shelton</h3>
            <p class="intro-text">
                I am a passionate and family-oriented web developer with a love for creating meaningful digital experiences.
                My journey in programming began when I discovered the power of turning ideas into functional and beautiful websites.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a background in Computer Science, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with
                exploring frameworks like React.js and Node.js. I enjoy the challenge of solving problems and the creativity
                involved in crafting elegant solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of coding, I am a dedicated family person. I believe in the importance of work-life balance
                and cherish moments spent with my loved ones. Being family-oriented is not just a value in my personal life,
                but it influences my approach to collaboration and teamwork in professional settings.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am always eager to learn, grow, and contribute to projects that have a positive impact. Whether it's
                creating intuitive user interfaces or solving complex technical challenges, I am committed to delivering
                high-quality results.
